# MIPSsuperscalar
Superscalar Pipelined MIPS Processor

In this project, I implemented a 4-wide out-of-order superscalar MIPS processor using Verilog. For this purpose, I used Tomasulo algorithm - added reservation stations for execution units and a re-order buï¬€er for in-order commit. I also
implemented a single-level cache and a branch prediction unit with branch target address prediction to improve the processor performance.
